Embedded Linux Hacker, Belgian Beer Drinker and Animal Lover

Currently living in London, I am an Embedded Linux Consultant for my own
company [Tuxable Ltd](/page/consulting). With a passion for Embedded Systems
and Open Source I am constantly on the lookout for new projects and
interesting system designs. I take pride in always aiming to contribute
back to the Open Source community and is one of the reasons I started this blog.

Most evenings and weekends I can be found hacking on projects and drinking
Belgian Gueze, with the company of my two Leopard Geckos or Guinea Pig. I
also enjoy a vast array of television shows and evenings at the pub.

Feel free to get in touch about any Linux based events, Open Source meet-ups
or if you just happen to be in London and fancy a pint.
